Board representation: Bitboards look promising.
                      ==> Are magic bitboards worth the difficulty?
                      ==> What about rotated bitboards?

Binary literals (i.e. 0b10011) were only introduced in c++14.
Also, digit separators are now allowed (i.e. 0b1001'0011'100110101'110)
    ==> Should be good for separating rows visually

Move generation: Use classical approach from chessprogramming.
    ==> Conceptually simpler, update it later on
